## Submission Instructions

### Overview
FeedMe is a decision making app for when you aren't able to decide on exactly what to eat! The first page has the option to login/register an account or go straight to using the generator features. Creating an account allows users to access the saved snacks, restaurants, and meals. Users have the option to choose FeedMe Now or FeedMe Later. With FeedMe Now, users input snack or fast food options and push a generator button. When you login your previous saved food pages will be there! So if you were in St. Louis and wrote up a list of food places in the area to randomly select from, you can go back if you ever happen to be in St. Louis again!
FeedMe Later directs users to a page where they access meal generators. The meal generator takes in user input of what’s in their pantry and outputs a list of recipes (from meal API). As they look through options based on cuisine and dietary needs (tags), they can save their favorite meals if they have an account. 

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create an interactive UI designed to simplify, customize, and/or downright remove the decision-making process when the thought, "I should eat something" first appears in the user's mind.
